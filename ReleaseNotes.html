                    <p align="left">The workspace for all example projects are contained in
                    the 'Examples' directory. The DotNET2008 solution file
                    is 'Examples\Examples_2008.sln'. The DotNET2010 solution is 'Examples_2010.sln' etc.
		</p>
		<p align="left">Each example has a &quot;readme.txt&quot; file that explains the brief outline 
			of each example.<BR>
			<STRONG>Example 4 </STRONG>is a particularly useful example that shows how to 
			use ReplicaNet inside a typical game situation where the game uses classes for 
			each object.<BR>
			The 'Docs' folder contains <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> generated documentation and CHM
        files for this build of 
			the libraries</p>
		<p align="left">The components to ReplicaNet are in the <STRONG>ReplicaNetPublic</STRONG>

<p><b>Compiling and linking</b><br>
This public release uses amalgamated source code for ReplicaNet and RNLobby client APIs. Just add &quot;ReplicaNetPublic\AmalgamatedReplicaNet.cpp&quot; to your project and an include path to &quot;ReplicaNetPublic\Includes&quot; then you're ready to compile.
This source includes all of the original client facing source code from the core ReplicaNet and RNLobby libraries.
The core libraries are around 100 C++ source files in around 12 projects with extra private headers that do not comprise the public interfaces.
The amalgamated source is simpler to include in a project and compile. An added bonus is that during testing the amalgamated source runs faster.
Most compilers are able to utilise extra optimisations when all the code is included into one block. Performance improvements of 5 to 10% have been measured.
<br />
Individual source files are available in the full SDK.

Full instructions are in the "Using ReplicaNet" section of the ReplicaNet class documentation.

        <b>Windows build notes<br>
        </b>

        DotNET2008 and DotNET2010 may produce &quot;libci.lib&quot; link problems when using
        some versions of the DirectX SDK. To resolve this problem add &quot;libci&quot;
        to Project Properties-&gt;Linker-&gt;Input-&gt;Ignore Specific Library.
		<P align="left">The graphical examples use the <b>Microsoft® DirectX® 9.0 SDK Update (April 2005)
                    </b>with patches for Visual Studio 6.0 from the <b> Microsoft® DirectX® 9.0 SDK Update (Summer 2003)</b>
                    and this was used to test the installation. This DirectX
                    version still maintains compiler support for Visual Studio 6.0
                    where later DirectX SDK versions remove this compiler
                    support. The
                    library and header files for this version of the DirectX SDK
                    can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.replicanet.com/DX90SDK.zip">http://www.replicanet.com/DX90SDK.zip</a>.</P>

		<P align="left">Some of the examples use the <b>Microsoft® WTL library</b>.<br>
                    The dotNET2008 and dotNET2010 projects have been tested with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=48cb01d7-112e-46c2-bb6e-5bb2fe20e626">WTL 7.5</a>

 Release V7.0</h3>
                     <p align="left"><b>Global additions and changes</b></p>
                    <ul>
<li><p align="left">Amalgamated source code is included, binary library builds are no longer needed.
</li>
<li><p align="left">FreewareSetRegistrationCode() and "RNPlatform/Inc/FreewareCode.h" are no longer needed and have been deprecated.
</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p align="left"><b>Additions and changes to ReplicaNet</b></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p align="left">RNPlatform/Inc/Rand.h has added RNReplicaNet::Rand::SeedFastWeak() and FastWeak() functions to avoid conflicts with the CRT srand() and rand() functions. All internal ReplicaNet calls to srand and rand have been replaced with this new API.

                      <li><p align="left">XPSession::SetProxyMode() and GetProxyMode() have been added. This allows a master session to act as a proxy for messages, only allowing messages to be routed through the master. Messages cannot be sent to or from the master. The master session ID is not not notified to other machines as a joiner or leaver, therefore ReplicaNet will not attempt to replicate objects to the master ID. This can be useful where a dedicated server needs to start a session to allow clients behind a restrictive firewall to connect and where the server does not want to receive any ReplicaObject updates. In effect a ReplicaNet session can connect to this proxy XPSession instance and not have to worry about superfluous object updates being sent to the master ID.
                      </li>
<li><p align="left">DataBlock_Predict_Float::GetLastDelta() Adds the ability to read the last received delta hint for a data block.

                    </b>The next version of ReplicaNet is planned to include one
                    significant breaking change for existing code. This change
                    will involve adding a RNReplicaNet namespace to the
                    components XPURL and XPSession. The helper classes attached
                    to ReplicaNet including, but not limited to, Encryption,
                    PlatformInfo, SysTime, MutexClass and ThreadClass will also be added to
                    the same RNReplicaNet namespace. The ReplicaNet component naming
                    will remain unchanged. The quick fix for existing code could
                    be to include &quot;using namespace RN ReplicaNet;&quot; at the
                    top of every CPP file or, less recommended, inside a header
                    file. The better fix would involve adding the prefix
                    namespace &quot;RNReplicaNet::&quot; to every referenced class
                    used in the ReplicaNet library, except the ReplicaNet class.<p align="left">The
                    second change to reduce header file name collisions will be
                    to change all of the header files for each component to
                    include the prefix &quot;ReplicaNet/Inc/&quot;. The examples
                    will be updated to reflect this change. To quickly fix
                    existing code the header include directory could include
                    both paths to the ReplicaNet include directory so that both
                    the long and short versions resolve to the same location.
                    The better fix could involve adding the necessary prefix to
                    all header files that include parts of ReplicaNet
                    components.<p align="left">These changes have been driven by the need for developers
                    to avoid potential name collisions for classes and header
                    files.<p align="left">This version will be called V5.0 to

	These allow objects to specify a distance and if that object is outside the distance to a session observer then that session does not get object updates.

                        component.<br>
                        The libraries that start with "DLL" will force the library DLL to be loaded at run time.<br>
                        When using the DLL libraries you must define DOREPNETEXPORTAPI in the
                        preprocessor. This ensures importing of the correct dll functions. It also automatically does #include
                        &quot;MemoryTracking.h&quot;<br>
                        The memory tracking header is needed to ensure that the dll calling method accounts for memory properly.<br>
                        The automatic inclusion of the header during DLL builds can be turned off by defining REPLICANET_NOAUTOMATICINCLUDEMEMORYTRACKING<br>
                        For non-dll builds the memory tracking header is not included.<br>
                        Specifically for ReplicaNet and DLL builds,
                        REPLICANET_DLLPREREGISTER() must used called before the ReplicaNet class is allocated. This ties the object classes to the DLL.<br>
                        REPLICANET_DLLPREREGISTER() can also be called in a non-DLL build without any adverse side effects.</li>
