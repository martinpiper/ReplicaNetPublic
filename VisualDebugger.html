                    <p align="left">The RNVisualDebugger application is a data analysis tool designed to 
                        aid the programmer in optimising object updates to lower network bandwidth. The 
                        debugger can connect to active network sessions or load offline debug files. 
                        During software testing and development these debug logs can be captured by the 
                        testing department and sent to the programmer for later analysis.</p>

                    <p align="left">The main windows consists of three sections:</p>
                    <ul>

                                type. In the above picture the list is currently blank because no objects have 
                                been selected.</p>
                        </li>

                        Circled in red can be seen two network bandwidth spikes somewhere between 514 
                        and 520 seconds. This document will show how to analyse one of the spikes to 
                        find out which object is the cause of this spike.
                    </p>

<h3>Analyse the bandwidth spike</h3>
<p>
    To analyse the spikes use the left mouse button to click drag and select an area 
    on the network bandwidth graph. The selection will appear with a white 
    background and purple bandwidth.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img alt="" class="style1" 
                            src="assets/images/VisualDebugger/Highlight.png" /></p>
<p>The above picture shows all of the object updates that occur during the selected 
    period. Looking at the scroll bar for the object update list there are a lot of 
    updates. This is expected because the updates in the selected area are from more 
    than just the object responsible for the bandwidth spike. A filter can be used 
    to clarify the data further. Using the right mouse button click drag and 
    highlight an area before and after the selected area.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img alt="" class="style1" 
                            src="assets/images/VisualDebugger/Filtered.png" /></p>
<p>
                    This filtering selection results in a much shorter list of object updates. In 
                    this example the only updates in the list are from the object called 
                    &quot;ReplicaNet.RNGRigidBody.Session 0.ID 11&quot; and the time this object is first 
                    logged is at 519.2 seconds. This corresponds with the time the network spike is 
                    seen in the network graph view. It is reasonable to conclude that the object 
                    spawning and moving has created a spike in the bandwidth. The tree view can be 
                    used to select and analyse object update packets. For example expand the 
                    RNGRigidBody node, followed by Session 0, ID 11 and tick the box.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img alt="" class="style1" 
                            src="assets/images/VisualDebugger/Treeview.png" /></p>
                    <p>
                        This shows the &quot;ReplicaNet.RNGRigidBody.Session 0.ID 11&quot; object has been sent to 
                        session ID 2 and 3 at 519.2 seconds. At 519.5 seconds a delete update was sent 
                        to session ID -2 which is the broadcast session. This shows the object was in 
                        the network session for less than a second. It is also possible to check the 
                        other sub-tree boxes related to this object and see how frequently the other 
                        class member variables update. If the programmer concludes these update too 
                        frequently (or too seldom) the DataBlock filter parameters can be adjusted.
